### Welcome to my coding site with resources and some cool material provided by me written in both English and Spanish ðŸ‘‹

## âš¡âš¡âš¡ A little about me âš¡âš¡âš¡

ðŸ”­ Right now I'm working as an intern on an enterprise called eJAmerica where I'm learning some JavaScript and NodeJS

ðŸŒ± I'm so much about reading and learning by myself, so, on my free time I'm reading articles about programming and I try to implement what I actually learned

ðŸ‘¯ Also, I'm right now collaborating with Fortin Tech, a startup made by a friend of mine called Adolfo PÃ©rez and his brother Armando for a service called APAMED

ðŸ¤” Along with the above, I'm still a student. Right now I'm studying my last semester in the Faculty of Enginnering at UNAM in Mexico City and I'm taking a diplomat of iOS Development Apps so I can take it as an option to have my degree in Computer Engineering.

ðŸ’¬ Wanna get in touch with me?

## Hey but, why Codedvil? ðŸ¤”

ðŸ˜„ It's a kind of acronym between code/loving to code/loving to do and undo code (Code) and my name (EdVil as Edgar Vilchis). The name came out in a cool chat during a Graphics Computing class.
