## Software Engineer | iOS Developer

- ‍‍💻 Currently working at Globant as an iOS Developer.

🌱 I'm so much about reading and learning by myself, so, on my free time I'm reading articles about programming and I try to implement what I actually learned

👯 Also, I'm right now collaborating with Fortin Tech, a startup made by a friend of mine called Adolfo Pérez and his brother Armando for a service called APAMED

🤔 Along with the above, I have a degree in Computer Engineering from the National Autonomous University of Mexico.

## Hey but, why Codedvil? 🤔

😄 It's a kind of acronym between code/loving to code/loving to do and undo code (Code) and my name (EdVil as Edgar Vilchis). The name came out in a cool chat during a Graphics Computing class.
